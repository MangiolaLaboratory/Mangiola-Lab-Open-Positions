# Mangiola-Lab-Open-Positions
This repository lists the current open positions in the Mangiola Laboratory 

The Stefano Mangiola Research Group at SAiGENCI (Adelaide) with co-appointment at WEHI (Melbourne) is at the forefront of computational immunogenomics, employing machine-learning techniques to advance cancer diagnosis and treatment. Our interdisciplinary and international team collaborates extensively with immunology, cancer biology and machine learning experts, leveraging state-of-the-art experimental data to unravel biological processes and novel biomedical applications. 

## Areas of research

1) Machine-learning artificial intelligence, and Bayesian statistics to undersdtand the immune system
2) Data-drive cancer immunodiagnosis (e.g. Mangiola et al. 2023)
3) Large-scale infrastructure development for single-cell, spatial data organisation and mining (e.g. CuratedAtlasQueryR)

The position is for a postdoctoral fellow in spatial and single-cell computational immunogenomics for cancer diagnosis. This position will advance cancer diagnosis by analysing immune responses and treatment efficacy through data-driven research and a multi-omic approach. Exploring the dynamics of circulating immune cells in blood reveals crucial insights into the immune system's response, its efficacy against metastatic cancer, and its reaction to treatments. Profiling peripheral blood immune single cells and circulating cytokines, we uncovered patterns of immune cell communication and composition linked to metastatic progression (Mangiola et al. 2023).  


This exciting position aims to expand this research to encompass the local tumour microenvironment and apply this approach to identify individual immune characteristics influencing immunotherapy success. We aim to employ a multiomic approach, analysing extensive patient data across all stages of disease progression. This research will utilise state-of-the-art facilities, including 10x Xenium, 10x CITE-seq, Milliplex and proteomics. 

We're searching for a dynamic individual for the Computational Biologist/Bioinformatician/Biostatistician role. Managing personal research funds is a possibility depending on the appointment level and the candidate's experience.
